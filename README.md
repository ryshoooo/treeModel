## Tree input data modelling
This is a Python package, which includes a modelling library 
with tree-shaped input data. The basic idea is to move away
from the standard 2D shape into tree type of shape and try
to train standard machine learning models using the information
from tree branches and utilizing the co-dependency information.

#### NB: Still in early development!!
##### The current supported version is 0.0.1. (super ealy alpha)

### Installation

#### Installation via cloning:

1. clone this repository to your desired folder
2. type and run `cd treeModel`
3. type and run `pip install .`

NB: The library is afterwards installed to your standard Python
packages and you are able to import it via `import treemodel`
command in Python.

#### Installation via distributed source:

``TODO: NOT IN PLACE YET (probably only when the first 
official early alpha release is ready)``

### How to use treeModel library
``TODO: Official documentation will be posted when early
alpha release is ready. Currently I'm working on at least
an example jupyter notebook where some of the basic 
functionality is going to be shown.``
